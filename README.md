# UART Protocol Implementation

## Overview
The UART Protocol Implementation project is designed to provide a robust and flexible UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication module using Verilog for FPGA platforms. The project aims to facilitate reliable serial communication between devices, ensuring accurate data transfer through configurable settings.

## Specifications
- **Configurable BAUD Rate:** Adjustable to match the required communication speed.
- **Data Bits:** Supports 5, 6, 7, 8 data bits for flexibility.
- **Parity Bit:** Configurable for even, odd, or no parity.
- **Stop Bits:** Supports 1 or 2 stop bits for synchronization.
- **Flow Control:** Optional hardware flow control using RTS/CTS.

## Approach
1. **Design:** Developed a detailed design for the UART transmitter and receiver modules using Verilog HDL.
2. **Simulation:** Verified the functionality and performance of the UART modules through extensive simulations in ModelSim.
3. **Component Selection:** Chose FPGA as the implementation platform to leverage its flexibility and performance.
4. **Implementation:** Implemented the design on an FPGA board and tested it with various BAUD rates and configurations.
5. **Verification:** Conducted comprehensive testing to ensure reliable data transmission and reception under different conditions.

## Getting Started
To start using the UART Protocol Implementation project:
1. Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.
2. Open the project files in your preferred FPGA design software (e.g., Quartus, Vivado).
3. Compile the Verilog modules for the UART transmitter and receiver.
4. Load the compiled design onto your FPGA board.
5. Connect the UART module to your test environment (e.g., a PC with a terminal program).
6. Configure the BAUD rate and other settings to match your communication requirements.
7. Start transmitting and receiving data through the UART interface.
